I'm a software engineer living in Oakland CA.  My early career focused on marketing and design, running a small branding company and leading marketing for a multimillion dollar manufacturer. After 5 years in those fields I realized that I was unahppy and board and got me to where I am today. 

I love software engineering because lets me solve interesting problems and make useful things. I'm delighted that I found things that address everything I'm good at, from working with people to problem solving to creative thinking.
